What's easy to do in Scala? What's not?

Scala makes functional programming and object-oriented programming easier. However, it can be difficult to learn Scala's syntax and approach if you are coming from a background in Java or another language. I found it particulalry easy just to write quick recursive function and debugging was fairly easy as well. 

So far, what is/are your favorite language design choice(s) that the designers of Scala made? Why?

One of my favorite language design choices of Scala is its functional programming capabilities, as it supports many functional programming concepts, making it easier to write cleaner, concise code. Additionally, Scala's type inference system makes the code more readable and concise.

So far, what is/are your least favorite language design choice(s)? Why? And why do you think the designers made that / those choice(s)?

One of my least favorite language design choices of Scala is its verbose syntax, which can be confusing and make code harder to read. However, this verbose syntax can be useful in making code more explicit, which is important in large projects. For instance I had to look up what syntax can be used to append an item to a list since you cannot use the += oporator on a list. 

What Scala features would you like to learn more about?

I would like to learn more about Scala's concurrency features, such as its support for parallel programming and actor-based programming. Additionally, I would like to learn more about Scala's advanced type system and its capabilities for type-level programming.
